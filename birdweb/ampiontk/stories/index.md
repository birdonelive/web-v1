## 2. The Mosquito Army
One hot summer day, Ampion was playing in his backyard when he suddenly felt an itch on his arm. He looked down and saw a mosquito biting him.
"Ow!" Ampion yelled, as he quickly swatted the mosquito away.
But as soon as he did, he noticed that there were hundreds, if not thousands, of mosquitoes swarming around him.
"What's going on here?" Ampion thought to himself, as he tried to fend off the mosquitoes with his arms.
But no matter how hard he tried, the mosquitoes seemed to be everywhere, biting him all over his body.
"This is ridiculous!" Ampion yelled, as he ran inside to escape the swarm of mosquitoes.
As he closed the door behind him, he saw that there were even more mosquitoes flying around outside, as if they were trying to get in.
"This is an army of mosquitoes!" Ampion exclaimed, as he tried to catch his breath.
But even though there were over a million mosquitoes trying to bite him, Ampion was determined to stay safe. He quickly grabbed some bug spray and started spraying it all around the room.
The mosquitoes were no match for the bug spray, and they quickly retreated, leaving Ampion alone and relieved.
"Phew, that was close," Ampion said to himself, as he collapsed onto the couch, exhausted from the ordeal.
From that day on, Ampion always made sure to have plenty of bug spray on hand, just in case the mosquitoes decided to attack again. And he lived happily ever after, safe from the bites of the pesky mosquitoes.<br>
